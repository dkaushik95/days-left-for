# Days left for

Days left for is an extension which overrides your new tab with a simple days counter. This can be helpful if you want to get reminded of something important but don't want to open a calendar for it. It keeps your top visited websites and your recent search history to keep functionality. Wallpapers powered by Unsplash.
